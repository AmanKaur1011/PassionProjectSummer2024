# PassionProjectSummer2024

## Purpose of this project:
I built an Amazon Workplace Management system. In this system, any employee of Amazon can see the list of other employees working among different 
departments, as well as the number of departments in Amazon with the department information and the position or the roles in the company with the 
details about that role. 
The administrator would have the full control over the system to manage it efficiently. Administrator can add new employees to the system, update the
current employee information and can also delete the previous employees. Similarly, the Administrator can also add new departments or a new Position(role), update the current 
department information, or update the current Position details like updating the wage associated with the position, and can also delete the old departments and positions.

### Basic Features of the system:
- Create, read, update, and delete functionality for the employees by the Administrator only.
- Create, read, update, and delete functionality for the departments by the Administrator only.
- Create, read, update, and delete functionality for the Positions by the Administrator only.
